# Kyrksok.se web-client

Kyrksok.se is a catalog of churches in Sweden. Kyrks√∂k was originally developed during Hack4Heritage (2016). All data used is aggregated through Wikidata and indexed from many sources such as Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons. This web-client is a static website built with [Snowman](https://github.com/glaciers-in-archives/snowman) directly on top of a SPARQL endpoint.

## Contributing

This project is built from Go templates and SPARQL queries using the static site generator [Snowman](https://github.com/glaciers-in-archives/snowman).

### Prerequisites

 - Git
 - [Snowman](https://github.com/glaciers-in-archives/snowman)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kyrkosok/web-client.git kyrksok-client

cd kyrksok-client

snowman build
```

Note that it's highly recommended that you use a local instance of the Wikidata query service as the initial build process will issue thousands of SPARQL queries.
